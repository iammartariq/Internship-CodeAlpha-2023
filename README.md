<h1 align="center" id="title">Voice Assistant</h1>

<p id="description">This virtual voice assistant works like your very own google-voice-assistant or Siri. I have used speech_recognition and pyttsx3 libraries in python to design and create a responsive and interactive voice assistant. FEATURES: ‚Ä¢ Modules/Libraries 1. speech_recognition to capture and interpret the commands of users accurately. 2. pyttsx3 implementation for clear and natural responses. 3. Webbrower allows the user to search the web directly through their voice commands. 4. datetime provides the user with current time on request. The virtual voice assistant listens the voice input and adjusts the ambient noises to ensure more accuracy. It then converts the speech (user‚Äôs command/input) into text using Google‚Äôs speech recognition. It provides the users with adjusted responds (as per now limited responses are available only) while also providing the user with current time conducts web searches and more. The virtual voice assistant is designed to gracefully manage the unrecognized commands/input and system errors.</p>
